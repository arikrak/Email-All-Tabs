Email All Tabs allows you to email all the tabs in current window to someone (or yourself).
Instead of having to copy and paste each link, you can send them all with one click. 
Make sure to set your preferred email provider for email links.
This extension can be more effective when combined with a tab-managing extension such as "Tab Scissors".
