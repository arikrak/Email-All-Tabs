Email All Tabs allows you to email all the tabs in current window to someone (or yourself).
Instead of having to copy and paste each link, you can send them all with one click.
It copies all the tabs in the current window to your clipboard and opens up your email provider so you can easily paste them in.
Make sure to set your preferred email provider for email links.
